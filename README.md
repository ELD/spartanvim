# SpartaNvim Version 2.0

This is a rebuild of the SpartaNvim distribution designed from the ground up
to fit my specific needs. My first pass at a vim configuration was with
following Runvim's setup pretty closely, but several things diverged. For one,
I started using lsp-zero instead of lsp-config and other utilities. I'm not sure
that was the right idea, so this time around, I'm not going to use packages like
that.

Additionally, that configuration was slanted towards C and C++ development while
I'm much more a Golang, Rust, TypeScript developer, so those will be my tools of
choice--especially the Rust piece.

## Plugins
